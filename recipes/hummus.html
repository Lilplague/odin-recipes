    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>    
        <li>400-500g of chickpeas, canned or self-prepared</li>
        <li>100-150g of tahini or olive oil</li>
        <p>Tahini is essentially sesame seed paste, and is what is traditionally used for hummus. Olive oil is a inferior but more accessible alternative to tahini, but good hummus is made entirely of tahini.</p>
