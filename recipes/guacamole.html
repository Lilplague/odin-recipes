    <h2>it comes to versatility and creative liberty, none can beat the Guacamole. The recipe presented below is what I prepare regularly, and it impresses family and friends without failure. Let's start cooking!</h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
        <li>ripe avocados</li>
        <li>lemon or lime</li>
        <li>pickled chillies, any type of your choosing</li>
        <li>paprika</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <p>Note: You can modify this list any way you like, as long as the avocados are present.</p>
    
    <h3>preparation</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Deshell the avocados. Either by scooping with a spoon or peeling off the skin (don't forget the giant pit!)</li>
        <li>Mash the now skinless avocados. Use any mashing tool, a fork is what I normally use.</li>
        <li>Dice up the pickled chillies on a seperate platter or board and add them in.</li>
        <li>Zest the lemon or lime with a fine grater for added flavor.</li>
        <p>Note: Zesting is taking off the colored part of a citrus fruit's skin (zest), which is above the bitter white portion of the skin (pith)</p>
        <li>Chop the fruit in half and squeeze out the juice onto the avocados</li>
        <li>Add salt, pepper and paprika. Remember to be generous with the salt! Guacamole is known for being forgiving when it comes to salt and acidity.</li>
        <li>mix it up!</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Wew! Now you have yourself a beautiful platter of Guacamole, ready to be enjoyed on bread, meat, or whatever you wish! </p>
