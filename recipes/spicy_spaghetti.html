        <li>Melt butter/oil in wok or pot at medium heat</li>
        <li>Add onions and garlic</li>
         <p>Now, we are going to caramelize the onions, have a kettle or cup full of water nearby and pour some in once there is some browning at the bottom of the cookware, you will repeat this multiple times.</p>

        <li>Once the onions and garlic are caramelized to your liking: add paprika, salt and cayenne pepper,</li>
        <li>Add mince and carrots and cook until carrots are soft</li>
        <li>Check boiling pasta for doneness, if they are soft, drain them and put in a separate container or in the same pot.</li>
        <li>Once carrots are soft and meat is cooked, add tomato paste, mustard and yoghurt/milk and mix in low heat</li>
        <li>Add in pasta</li>
